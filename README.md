### What is Project Athena?
Athena is an AI-driven swear-word detecting chatbot based on Python's NLTK (natural language toolkit) library. 
The project will be presented in a form of a chatbot, but its model can be implemented into social media platforms, working platforms or anything that requires censoring. 

### Why Swear-Word Detecting?
> "The foolish and wicked practice of profane cursing and swearing is a vice so mean and low that every person of sense and character detests and despises it."- George Washington

To make social media and learning platforms beneficial to the grow of children, it is important to abandon swear words within these platforms so that they can live in a verbal-friendly, polite community. The connotation behind each words, offensive, yet also violent to everyone who senses it. Hence, for the sake of benefiting child development and improving censorship, we decided to make a swear-word detecting system.
